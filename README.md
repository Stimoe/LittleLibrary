# The Little Free Library Community App
The app can be found at, https://little-library-app.herokuapp.com

## Description
This is a user driven application that helps build communities through literacy! Users of this app will be accessing physical books from a local "Little Free Library" [littlefreelibrary.org]. Users will first create an account and search for their local 'Little Library' and then access the database of books to add, borrow, or update any missing or untracked books.  Users also have the ability to write reviews to post to a discussion board that is specific to that title at that individual library, thus enabling a dialogue between neighbors which can foster and deepen connections and understanding in that community.

## Product Status
Our proposal to the littlefreelibrary.org was politely declined.  We do have ambitions to apply this app to unassociated "little libraries" as the regard for truly "free", unregistered little libraries has been growing. Please check back with us to see the status.

This app is still in beta, so please notify us of any bugs you may experience.
